#### About our App

Closet Tracker is a mobile application developed with Expo Go and React Native that helps users organize and manage their wardrobes efficiently.

Closet Tracker allows users to track clothing items, plan outfits, and gain a better idea of which clothes need to be cleaned. The app is designed for individuals who want to stay organized and make the most of their clothing collection. Users can log their wardrobe by adding pictures of their clothing, and the app will organize the items according to color, category, etc. The app will also recommended outfits depending on various factors such as weather and calendar events. The user will be able to visualize these outfits on a virtual avatar to ensure they are satisfied with the items. Regular users can add, edit, and delete wardrobe items, plan outfits, and track their clothing usage. Currently, we have no plans to include users with different permissions.

The frontend of the app will rely on React Native with Expo Go to ensure compatibality with mobile devices. We also plan on using Firebase for user authentication and database management.

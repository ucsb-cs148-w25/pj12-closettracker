I have contributed to numerous features and bug fixes in this course. Including but not limited to pipeline of obtaining source image from user (gallery/camera), API call to remove background of user image, entire pipeline of creating outfits from clothing items, home page with social aspects, bug fixes for difference between android and iOS, initial styling according to chosen palette, initial wardrobe page design, the application's routing structure (dynamically adjust to authentication), numerous bug fixes, and refactoring and fixing everyone's PRs, merge conflicts, and applying new features to all of app.

**Commentary on graph**

The graph is accurate in terms of my contributions. I have contributed to the project throughout the quarter. The number of lines added and deleted are likely exaggerated due to differences in autogenerated package-lock file.

Throughout this course so far, I contributed to various features, most notably including the UI for the upload page, integrating Supabase with Firebase for image retrieval + display, and additions to the user profile page (profile pictures + descriptions). I have also added on to work done by my peers, such as adding a filter feature to the wardrobe page and allowing users to add their profile pictures to their outfits. 

**Commentary on graph**

The graph accurately displays my commits throughout the weeks. However, it notes that I have edited (added/removed) over 64,000 lines of code. I do not believe this number is accurate as it probably includes extraneous files from merges, packages, refactors, and the Hello, World deliverable.

I contributed fairly to the project through this quarter. At the beginning, I created empty screens and screen prototypes for the wardrobe page and laundry page, which my teammates later added to. I added onto their work by editing the UI for some buttons to make the icons and purposes more clear. I also fixed a few bugs, such as the dropdown menu being unscrollable, the keyboard covering the text input, and the edit button resetting the item's data. Lastly, as the QA Coordinator, I added acceptance criteria to Kanban board items as well as monitored issues, linked them to PR's, and closed them when needed.

**Commentary on graph**

My contributions on the graph are fairly accurate. The ranking by commit level is accurate. The number of lines added and deleted are likely exaggerated due to differences in autogenerated package files. In general, it might be more accurate to compare by number of PR's than commits.

I implemented user authentication using Firebase and connected the wardrobe frontend to the Firebase database to store and retrieve user-specific clothing items. I also set up Supabase for image storage, ensuring that uploaded images were displayed on the wardrobe page. Additionally, I contributed to improving the app's modularity by creating a reusable component for displaying clothing items, allowing it to be easily used across multiple pages.

**Commentary on graph**

The graph pretty accurately displays my contributions throughout the quarter. I would say that the amount of lines edited may be an oversetimate due to the massive files of packages I may have pushed.

### Victor Nardi

Throughout this project, I developed the editPage and the singleItem page. The edit page lets users edit and upload clothing metadata into the Firebase. My peers have added to this page's functionality so that it can also be used for outfits. The singleItem page displays an individual piece of clothing's data and allows a user to update how many times a user has worn a piece of clothing. My peers also worked on this page, extending the functionality to include outfits as well. I also worked on the components for each of these pages. The components are "TimesWornComponent" and "ClothingDataDropdowns". I also created two tests for our labs, one unit test and one component test.

**Commentary on graph**

I don't think the graph is super accurate. I believe I sufficiently contributed to the project. However some of my peers contributed more than me. The graph has me at third for commits. This is because I manually change some of markdown files through the github and automatically push it.

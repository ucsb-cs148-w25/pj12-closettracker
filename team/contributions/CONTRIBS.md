Throughout this project, I developed the editPage and the singleItem page. The edit page lets users edit and upload clothing metadata into the Firebase. My peers have added to this page's functionality so that it can also be used for outfits. The singleItem page displays an individual piece of clothing's data and allows a user to update how many times a user has worn a piece of clothing. My peers also worked on this page, extending the functionality to include outfits as well. I also worked on the components for each of these pages. The components are "TimesWornComponent" and "ClothingDataDropdowns". I also created two tests for our labs, one unit test and one component test.

**Commentary on graph**

I don't think the graph is super accurate. I believe I sufficiently contributed to the project. However some of my peers contributed more than me. The graph has me at third for commits. This is because I manually change some of markdown files through the github and automatically push it.

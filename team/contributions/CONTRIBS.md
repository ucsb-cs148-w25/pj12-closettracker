Throughout this course so far, I contributed to various features, most notably including the UI for the upload page, integrating Supabase with Firebase for image retrieval + display, and additions to the user profile page (profile pictures + descriptions). I have also added on to work done by my peers, such as adding a filter feature to the wardrobe page and allowing users to add their profile pictures to their outfits. 

**Commentary on graph**

The graph accurately displays my commits throughout the weeks. However, it notes that I have edited (added/removed) over 64,000 lines of code. I do not believe this number is accurate as it probably includes extraneous files from merges, packages, refactors, and the Hello, World deliverable.

I implemented user authentication using Firebase and connected the wardrobe frontend to the Firebase database to store and retrieve user-specific clothing items. I also set up Supabase for image storage, ensuring that uploaded images were displayed on the wardrobe page. Additionally, I contributed to improving the app's modularity by creating a reusable component for displaying clothing items, allowing it to be easily used across multiple pages.

**Commentary on graph**
The graph pretty accurately displays my contributions throughout the quarter. I would say that the amount of lines edited may be an oversetimate due to the massive files of packages I may have pushed.

Throughout this project, I developed the editPage and the singleItem page. The edit page lets users edit and upload clothing metadata into the Firebase. My peers have added to this page's functionality so that it can also be used for outfits. The singleItem page displays an individual piece of clothing's data and allows a user to update how many times a user has worn a piece of clothing. My peers also worked on this page, extending the functionality to include outfits as well. I also worked on the components for each of these pages. The components are "TimesWornComponent" and "ClothingDataDropdowns". I also created two tests for our labs, one unit test and one component test.

**Commentary on graph**

I don't think the graph is super accurate. I believe I sufficiently contributed to the project. However some of my peers contributed more than me. The graph has me at third for commits. This is because I manually change some of markdown files through the github and automatically push it.

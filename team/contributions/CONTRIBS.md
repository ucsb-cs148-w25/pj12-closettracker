Over the course of this project I developed the editPage and the singleItem page. The edit page enables users to edit and upload clothing meta data into the firebase. My peers have added to this pages functionality so that it can also be used for outfits. The singleItem page dislpays and individual piece of clothing's data and allows a user to update how many times a user have worn a piece of cloathing.

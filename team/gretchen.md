# Gretchen Lam

Hello, my name is Gretchen Lam, and I am a fourth year computer science student. My interests lie in AI/ML, particularly within computer vision. In my free time, I like playing silly games, crocheting, and exploring Santa Barbara.

I plan for this project to be a useful tool when considering your closet and coordinating possible outfits. In addition to tracking what's in your laundry, our app allows for uploading images of your clothes to create outfits. In order to ensure clothes are being well-worn (and washed), our app also tracks the number of times pieces are worn and when they are cleaned.

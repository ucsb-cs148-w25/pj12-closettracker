## Problem Scenario

Chris Gaucho is a busy college student at UCSB with a packed schedule of classes, research, and social events. Despite being organized in other areas of life, Chris struggles to keep track of their clothing. Every morning, Chris faces a frustrating routine of rummaging through a disorganized closet, trying to decide what to wear for the day. This often leads to:

- Wasted Time: Chris spends too much time searching for specific items or deciding what to wear.
- Forgotten Items: Clothes at the back of the closet or in storage are often forgotten and go unworn for months.
- Redundancy: Chris occasionally purchases clothing similar to what they already own, simply because they can't remember what's in their wardrobe.

## Chris needs a Closet Tracker App that can:

- Digitally catalog all clothing items with photos, categories (e.g., tops, pants, shoes), and tags for color, material, and occasion.
- Suggest outfits based on weather, events, or preferences.
- Track usage frequency to highlight underused items.
- Offer organization tips, such as when to rotate seasonal clothing or declutter.
- Integrate with Chrisâ€™s calendar to suggest outfits for upcoming events.
- The app would save Chris time, improve their daily routine, and help them make sustainable clothing choices while staying organized and stylish.

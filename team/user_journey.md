## User Journey

Chris Gaucho, a busy UCSB student, struggles with managing their disorganized wardrobe, often wasting time finding clothes, forgetting items, or buying duplicates. Seeking a solution, Chris downloads the Closet Tracker App to simplify their routine. After a quick setup where Chris uploads photos of their clothes, the app creates a digital catalog, categorizing items by type, color, and occasion. Additionally, Chris can view their clothes on a customizable avatar with their face, making it easier to visualize outfits. The app suggests daily outfits based on weather and events, helping Chris save time and rediscover forgotten items, transforming chaotic mornings into an efficient routine.

Over time, the app provides additional value by tracking clothing usage, highlighting underused items, and offering tips for decluttering and seasonal rotation. Chris also uses the app for special event preparation, receiving tailored outfit recommendations synced with their calendar. With monthly insights into wardrobe trends, sustainable shopping suggestions, and the ability to virtually mix and match outfits on their avatar, Chris builds a functional, stylish wardrobe, achieving their goal of organization and efficiency.

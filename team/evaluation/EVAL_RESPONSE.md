# Team Decisions Based on USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md

## 1. Decisions Regarding Feedback on USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md
After reviewing the feedback provided in the USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md, our team has decided to implement the following changes to improve the appâ€™s usability and user experience:

- **Add labels for buttons**: Many users found navigation between pages unclear due to the lack of text labels. We will add text labels for the closet, laundry, and other important sections to improve usability.
- **Make the laundry button more intuitive**: Users were confused about the laundry feature and its navigation. We will either rename it or provide additional guidance to clarify its function.
- **Reset wear count when taking clothes out of laundry**: Some users suggested that the wear count should reset when clothing is moved out of the laundry section. We will incorporate this change to make the feature more logical.
- **Include tunnel mode instructions in README**: Some users encountered issues with running the app, specifically with `npx expo start`. To mitigate this, we will include guidance on running the app in tunnel mode within the README.
- **Add more categories for uploading clothing**: Users wanted additional categorization options when uploading clothing. We will expand the existing categories to offer more flexibility.

## 2. Additional Decisions Based on Specific Feedback
### Section 2: UI/UX Improvements
- **Improve first-time user experience**: Some users found it difficult to navigate the closet and laundry pages at first. We will consider adding a first-time user tutorial or onboarding instructions.
- **Ensure all mandatory fields are clearly marked**: Users mentioned that there were many fields to fill out when uploading clothing. We will make it clear which fields are mandatory and which are optional.
- **Fix UI issue where white space at the top covers the time and date**: Some users reported this issue; we will ensure it is resolved for a smoother experience.

### Section 3: Feature Enhancements
- **Comment section for public items**: Users expressed interest in engaging more socially with the app. We will explore adding a comment feature to allow users to discuss public wardrobe items.
- **Wear count of an outfit should increment individual clothing item counts**: Users suggested that when an outfit is worn, each item within the outfit should have its wear count incremented. We will implement this feature.
- **Allow duplicate clothing items**: Some users indicated they might own multiple identical clothing pieces. We will consider adding a duplicate item feature.

### Section 4: Repo Structure & Deployment Improvements
- **Improve README.md with troubleshooting section**: Some users encountered deployment issues. We will expand the README to include troubleshooting steps.
- **Kanban board improvement**: Users suggested adding a "Drafts" section before tasks move to "To-Do." We will implement this for better organization.

### Section 5: Stretch Goals
- **Consider implementing a feature to sell clothes**: Some users suggested that the app could also be used as a platform for selling clothes. This is outside our current scope but could be a future consideration.
- **Improve profile customization**: Some users found the profile description styling to be unclear. We will refine it for a cleaner appearance.

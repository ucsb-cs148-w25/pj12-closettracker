# Retrospective 3, 03/07/25

* Led by: Gretchen Lam
* Present: Andrew Chen, Anvitha Kosuri, Sophia Tran, Victor Nardi, Daisy Zhong, Gen Tamada
* Absent: N/A

## Action Item
* A goal: Start closing issues on the Kanban Board more for our final product.
* A change: Track the Kanban Board more closely to make sure it accurately reflects our work being done.
* A measurement: Check how many more issues we have closed.

## Retro Assessment
* We used Slack for team members to send start, stop, and continue items. This ensures team members' opinions are not affected by each other. We then regrouped to discuss the main practices we want to implement and continue.
* Retro went well, team members agreed on many things. Great insight from start/stop/continue items.

## Experiment/Change
* What constitutes this change/experiment is our Kanban Board is a bit disorganized and needs to more accurately reflect our work, especially with the final presentation coming up. We want to start closing more issues.

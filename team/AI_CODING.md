I used ChatGPT to help me decide between two React components for a dropdown menu in the upload page. It gave me insight on why I might use one over the other. It also gave code snippet examples to help me get started with implementing the components. ChatGPT was pretty useful in helping me get started with new React components, especially since it's good with getting code to work. I can see myself using ChatGPT for coding purposes later on in this project as well. Everything was detailed clearly, and I plugged in the code that it gave me and adjusted it to fit our codebase. I also verified that everything was done properly by searching up the package it introduced to me and read through that documentation.

I used Copilot and ChatGPT to generate code snippets for the frontend. Since many of our apps have repetitive code, whether be components, style, and the use of similar imports and libraries to achieve similar functions (login, auth, database), the AI was really quick on learning the patterns and generating accurate code that is specific to our project (e.g. correct file import path, naming of custom components, understanding the purpose of our app). Overall, I had to do less tedious and repetitive work, and I was able to focus more on the logic and structure of the app. If in some cases that it generates a wrong output, I would go and read the code snippet myself, and furthermore investigate the corresponding API or library documentation to verify the code. This way, I can both learn and understand the code better, and also make sure that the code is correct and efficient.

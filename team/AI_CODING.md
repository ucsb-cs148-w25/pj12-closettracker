I used ChatGPT to help me decide between two React components for a dropdown menu in the upload page. It gave me insight on why I might use one over the other. It also gave code snippet examples to help me get started with implementing the components. ChatGPT was pretty useful in helping me get started with new React components, especially since it's good with getting code to work. I can see myself using ChatGPT for coding purposes later on in this project as well. Everything was detailed clearly, and I plugged in the code that it gave me and adjusted it to fit our codebase. I also verified that everything was done properly by searching up the package it introduced to me and read through that documentation.

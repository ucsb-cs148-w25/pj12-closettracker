We used the Jest testing library to add unit tests for our `UploadClothingComponent`.
The tests first verified that the single item's data was displayed correctly on the screen. Then, they checked that interacting with the text input and clicking submit successfully updated the database.

The unit test can be found in folder: closet-tracker/components/__tests__/ClothingDataDropdowns.test.tsx

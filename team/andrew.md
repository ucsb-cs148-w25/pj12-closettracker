My name is Andrew Chen and I am a second year cs major at UC Santa Barbara. My hobbies include playing soccer, watching netflix, and sleeping. I have a few ideas for this closet tracker app. We can have a page that displays everything we have in the wardrobe organized by the type of clothing, another page with an avatar where we can generate outfits, and a third page to keep track of clothings unavailable to wear because it is in the laundry. We can also implement a way to upload clothings from the wardrobe into the app by taking a picture uploading it.

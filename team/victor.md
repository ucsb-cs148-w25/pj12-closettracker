Hi, my name is Victor Nardi and I am a 3rd year CS student. In my free time, I like to cook :)

For this app, I would love to implement some sort of data analytics. No idea how just a thought that could be fun. Other than that I would just love to learn as much as possible about all the technologies we will be working with.

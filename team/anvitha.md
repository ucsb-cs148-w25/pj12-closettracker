My name is Anvitha Kosuri and I am currently a third year Computer Science student. Some of my hobbies include hiking, traveling, and playing pickleball. A few ideas I have for our project is adding a camera feature for the app to first analyze what pieces of clothing the user has. This way the user can take a picture of all their clothing items or outfits they repeat frequently. Furthermore, we could add a notifcation feature to alert users to take a picture of their current outfit at a specific time of day so the app could take into account the pieces of clothing which have been worn on that specific day and increment their count. Lastly, our app could have billboard features which includes the three worn clothing items in a given month and potentially year.
